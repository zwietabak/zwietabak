## 👋 Hi there

My name is Oliver Klein and I'm a professional Systems and Network / DevOps Engineer with over 14 Years of experience in the IT industry. I planed, implemented and managed different types of systems, services, networks and critical infrastructure.

In my free time I'm a passionate video gamer. Through my studies I got insight in the different topics of game development like programing, graphics game design and sound design. Right now I focus on game development with the Godot engine as a hobbyist and participate regularly at Game Jams.
Here you can have a look on public projects I worked on.

### Korpsgeist

Korpsgeist is a first person story driven mystery game that was developed during my studies in about 4 months.

You play a young police officer, fresh out of the academy, who’s been assigned to the night shift. Your task is to get a prisoner to confess through conversations held across the bars of his holding cell. You can offer him favors, negotiate with him, threaten him, or play psychological mind games.

But as time goes on, you begin to sense that something is following you through the entire police station.
